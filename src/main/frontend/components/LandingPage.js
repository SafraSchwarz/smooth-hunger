          We aim to help solve the social problem of hunger and the
          environmental problem of food waste by recycling produce. Our
          non-profit connects with businesses to collect produce that is at the
          end of its shelf life and uses this produce to create healthy vitamin
          rich smoothies for families in need. Additionally, we provide
          education and tools for families to create affordable nutritious
          meals.
